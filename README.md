# ti84
Some stuff for the ti-84 using the ce toolchain

## Installation
1. Check OS version using 2nd+[+] for mem, then press 1. If the OS version is less than [5.6](https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/158B7669E4C0493A84D33D9A22FDBD3C/ti-84plusceoperatingsystem), you can execute programs directly using the `Asm()` command. If it is greater than that but less than 5.8.3, you can install [arTIfiCE](https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE/) to execute assembly programs. If it's 5.8.3 or greater, you're cooked.
2. Copy the files from the bin folder into your calculator. You may want to leave out TEST.
3. Use the Asm() command or use the arTIfiCE shell to launch!
